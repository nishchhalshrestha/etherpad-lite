		"soffice": "", //(string) path to soffice command. If empty, default is 'soffice'.
		"keywords": "", //(string) keywords in headers (PDF and ODT).
		"author": "", //(string) author in headers (PDF and ODT). Set to "auto" to use the "title" global setting.
		"title": "", //(string) document title (PDF and ODT). You can use '%s' to refer to the pad Id (ie: "Document generated from the %s session.").
		"remove_LOdir": false,	//(boolean) remove or not the special LibreOffice folder (/tmp/LibOconversion/)  (version 0.0.4). Default value: false, not recreate it each conversion is more efficient.
